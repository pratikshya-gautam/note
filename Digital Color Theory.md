Hex is a number system. It has base of 16. Any color can be represent using this number system.
For eg #ffffff  is white color. Its like ->#<font color="#c00000">RR</font><font color="#00ff00">GG</font><font color="#245bdb">BB</font>

## RGB

## How many color should be used?
We should used only one color. If not sufficient, we can use up-to two colors. We can also use 3/4 colors but it will be more complex to build good design when there are more colors.
